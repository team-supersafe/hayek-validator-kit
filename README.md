## Pre-commit Hooks

We recommend using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically check your code for common issues before committing.

### Setup

1. Install pre-commit (requires Python):

   ```sh
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. Install the hooks:

   ```sh
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. (Optional) Run all hooks on all files:

   ```sh
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
