# Create symbolic link for htop
# ============================
# This task creates a symbolic link from the user installation to /usr/local/bin
# so that htop can be accessed system-wide while maintaining user ownership.
#
# Best practices:
# - Use file module for symbolic links
# - Check if link already exists before creating
# - Use force: yes to overwrite existing links
# - Maintain proper permissions and ownership
