# ===============================
# This task downloads htop source code from GitHub and extracts it to /tmp.
#
# Best practices:
# - Use remote_src: yes to download from external URL
# - Extract to /tmp to avoid conflicts with previous installations
# - The unarchive module automatically handles download and extraction
# - Use variables for URL and version for easy maintenance
