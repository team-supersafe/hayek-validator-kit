# Install build dependencies
# =========================
# This task installs all necessary packages to compile htop from source.
# Includes build tools, development libraries and dependencies.
#
# Best practices:
# - Use update_cache: yes to ensure repositories are up to date
# - Define dependencies in vars/main.yml for easy maintenance
# - Use state: present to install only if not already present
