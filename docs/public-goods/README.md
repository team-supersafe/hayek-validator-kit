# Hayek Public Goods

The Hayek Validator Kit is an open source public good for developers and sysadmins that want to run high performance Solana validators. It is a pre-configured toolkit that includes automation, dev ops, virtualization services, a local environment, key management tools, and monitoring utilities — everything you need to deploy, test, and operate a validator in Localnet, Testnet and Mainnet environments.

See the [Github Repo](hayek-validator-kit/github-repo.md) page to view how to use and contribute to the Hayek Validator Kit.

## Quickstart Setup

### 🧰 Step 1: Prepare Your Machine

Start by following the [Workstation Setup](hayek-validator-kit/workstation-setup.md) guide to ensure your system has the required tools and dependencies.

### 📦 Step 2: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/team-supersafe/hayek-validator-kit.git
cd hayek-validator-kit
```

### ▶️ Step 3: Run Solana Localnet

To spin up a local testnet environment:

```
./scripts/run-localnet.sh
```

This will start a local Solana network called Localnet with all of the Hayek Validator Kit components running in Docker.
