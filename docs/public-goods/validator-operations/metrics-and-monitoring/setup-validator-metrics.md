# Setup Validator Metrics - InfluxDB

Install InfluxDB in a different box from the validator servers. InfluxDB will receive metrics from the Telegraf agent installed on the validator servers as well as from other sources.

## Installation

For DEB-based platforms (e.g. Ubuntu, Debian), add the InfluxData repository with the following commands:

```bash
wget -q https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdata-archive_compat.key
echo '393e8779c89ac8d958f81f942f9ad7fb82a25e133faddaf92e15b16e6ac9ce4c influxdata-archive_compat.key' | sha256sum -c && cat influxdata-archive_compat.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/influxdata-archive_compat.gpg > /dev/null
echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/influxdata-archive_compat.gpg] https://repos.influxdata.com/debian stable main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/influxdata.list
```

Update package lists and install InfluxDB:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install influxdb -y
```

Start InfluxDB and enable it to run at system startup:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable influxdb
sudo systemctl start influxdb
```

## Configure InfluxDB

Connect to the InfluxDB shell:

```bash
influx
```

Or, if you need to connect with SSL (for self-signed or invalid certificates):

```bash
influx -ssl -unsafeSsl
```

### Create Databases

Our setup includes three main databases:

1. **Validator Metrics Database**: Receives metrics from Telegraf agents installed on validator servers.
2. **Monitoring Box Metrics Database**: Collects metrics from a separate monitoring system.
3. **Solana Block Production Database**: Tracks block production statistics from Solana validators.

For each database, follow these steps:

```bash
create database <database_name>
use <database_name>
```

### Create Users and Assign Permissions

For each database, create a user and grant appropriate permissions:

```bash
create user <username> with password '<password>'
grant all on <database_name> to <username>
```

## Setup Agave Watchtower

The watchtower is recommended to be installed in a separate box. We use watchtower for monitoring and alerting identity keys for Mainnet and Testnet. Critical metrics such as Identity balance and validator health are checked every minute.

### Prerequisites

- Solana CLI < URL Solana CLI Docs >
- Python # Used for monitoring scripts
- Telegram Group
- Discord WEBHOOK

### Installation

1. Install Solana CLI.
2. Create a service for agave watchtower. We recommend one service for each identity (Mainnet, Testnet, Debug).

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/agave-watchtower-mainnet.service
```

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Agave Watchtower Monitoring Service (Mainnet)
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/agave-watchtower \
  --url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com \
  --validator-identity [PUBKEY] \
  --interval 60 \                          
  --monitor-active-stake \
  --minimum-validator-identity-balance 5 \ # Minimum threshold for identity balance
  --rpc-timeout 30 \
  --name-suffix "server-name" \
  --unhealthy-threshold 1 \
  --ignore-http-bad-gateway
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Enable the service

```bash
systemctl enable agave-watchtower-mainnet.service
```

4. Start the service

```bash
systemctl start agave-watchtower-mainnet.service
```

At this point we don't send alerts to Telegram and Discord yet. We want to capture the metrics for agave watchtower and format them with Python. Then, through another service, we send the alerts to Discord and Telegram.

## Create Formatting Service for Mainnet

1. Create the Python script

```bash
nano /usr/local/bin/solana-alert-formatter-mainnet.py
```

2. Grant execution privileges for the script

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/solana-alert-formatter-mainnet.py
```

3. Create a service

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/solana-alert-formatter-mainnet.service
```

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Agave Watchtower Alert Formatter
After=agave-watchtower-mainnet.service  # This means this service only starts after the agave-watchtower-mainnet.service has been activated
Wants=agave-watchtower-mainnet.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/solana-alert-formatter-mainnet.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
This script is charged tosent the alert to DISCORD and TELEGRAM Chanels
Inside this sctipr we have some variables we need to be aware

```bash
# Alert Intervals (in seconds)
VALIDATOR_DELINQUENT_ALERT_INTERVAL = 180  # Time between delinquent alerts (3 minutes)
LOW_BALANCE_ALERT_INTERVAL = 60 # Time between alerts when the validator have low ballance
SUGGESTED_BALANCE = 10   # Suggested balance in SOL for identity accounts
# Enable/Disable specific alert types
ENABLE_DELINQUENT_ALERTS = True      # Set to False to disable validator delinquent alerts
ENABLE_RECOVERY_ALERTS = True        # Set to False to disable validator recovery alerts
ENABLE_LOW_BALANCE_ALERTS = True     # Set to False to disable low balance alerts
ENABLE_BALANCE_RECOVERY_ALERTS = True # Set to False to disable balance recovery alerts
# Communication platforms
ENABLE_DISCORD = True
ENABLE_TELEGRAM = True 
# Discord configuration
DISCORD_WEBHOOK = "webhooks_url"
# Telegram configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = ""
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = ""
```

4. Enable the service

```bash
systemctl enable solana-alert-formatter-mainnet.service
```

5. Start the service

```bash
systemctl start solana-alert-formatter-mainnet.service
```

## Service Maintenance and Monitoring

We must be aware that every time a service is changed, we need to reload the daemon and then restart the service:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
```

```bash
systemctl restart <SERVICE>
```

### Checking Service Logs

To monitor the services and troubleshoot issues, use these commands:

```bash
systemctl status <SERVICE>
```

```bash
journalctl -u <SERVICE> -f
```

## Additional Configurations

Repeat the process for each identity (Mainnet, Testnet, Debug) by creating separate services with appropriate configurations for each environment.

# Setup Validator Metrics - Outbox Monitoring

We pull metrics from several sources such as Stakewiz, Solana API, Solana CLI, Jpool, etc.

## Setup Service for Validators Metrics and Block Production Metrics

Create a service:
```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/validator-metrics.service
```

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Stakewiz Validator Metrics Sender (every 2 minutes)
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'while true; do /usr/local/bin/send_validator_metrics.sh & /usr/local/bin/send_block_metrics_v6.sh; wait; sleep 120; done'
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
User=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

The script "send_block_metrics_v6.sh" will send the metrics to a separate database which is only dedicated for block production metrics.
This script collects the metrics for block production through Solana CLI and also collects epoch information:
```bash
solana block <blocknumber>
solana epoch-info
```

## Configuration Variables

Here are some variables you should be aware of for this script:

```bash
# You can choose which networks to analyze by changing these variables to true/false
PROCESS_MAINNET=true
PROCESS_TESTNET=false  # Change to true if you want to process testnet
PROCESS_DEBUG=false    # Change to true if you want to process debug

# MAINNET
MAINNET_VOTE_ACCOUNT="<VOTEKEY>"
MAINNET_IDENTITY_KEY="<PUBKEY>"
MAINNET_RPC_API="https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
MAINNET_HOST="<SERVERNAME>"

# ===== INFLUXDB CONFIGURATION =====
INFLUX_URL="https://influxdb-server-url:8086"
INFLUX_DB="validator_blocks"
INFLUX_USER="<DB_USER>"
INFLUX_PASS="<DB_PASSWORD>"  

# ===== PATH TO SOLANA BIN =====
SOLANA_BIN="/root/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin/solana"
```

This script "/usr/local/bin/send_validator_metrics.sh" obtein metrics from Solana clusters API and solana CLI, else pull metrics from stakewiz API.

Here are some variables you should be aware of for this script:

```bash
MAINNET_VOTE_ACCOUNT="<VOTEKEY>"
MAINNET_IDENTITY_KEY="<PUBKEY>"
MAINNET_RPC_API="https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
MAINNET_HOST="<SERVERNAME>"
MAINNET_STAKEWIZ_ENABLED=true # If is false don't pull metrics from stakewiz APi 
MAINNET_GOSSIP_ENABLED=true 

# ===== INFLUXDB CONFIGURATION =====
INFLUX_URL="https://validator.secu.one:8086"
INFLUX_DB="< INFLUX_DATABASE>"
INFLUX_USER="<DB_USER>"
INFLUX_PASS="<DB_PASSWORD>"

# ===== ABSOLUTE PATH TO SOLANA BIN =====
SOLANA_BIN="/root/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin/solana"
```

## Grant execution privileges to the scripts

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/send_block_metrics_v6.sh
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/send_validator_metrics.sh
```

## Install service to pull Jpool Rank from https://app.jpool.one/validators/<VOTEKEY>

Jpool doesn't have an API which we can use to get metrics and scores, so we had to use scraping methods to get the metrics. JPool doesn't use Cloudflare Turnstile for captcha challenge, so we are able to get these metrics.

First we need to create a Python virtual environment to install some dependencies.

## Install and create Python virtual environment

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv
```

## Create Python virtual environment

```bash
sudo python3 -m venv /root/venv
```

## Activate virtual environment

```bash
source /root/venv/bin/activate
```

## Install dependencies into virtual environment

```bash
/root/venv/bin/pip install flask playwright
# Install browser playwright, which is necessary for scraping 
/root/venv/bin/python -m playwright install
```

## Close Python virtual environment

```bash
deactivate
```

## Create the service

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/tvc-api.service
```

```bash
[Unit]
Description=TVC Rank API with Flask and Playwright
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
ExecStart=/root/venv/bin/python /usr/local/bin/get_tvc_rank.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Grant execution privileges for the script

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/get_tvc_rank.py
```

## Enable the service

```bash
systemctl enable tvc-api.service
```

## Start the service

```bash
systemctl start tvc-api.service
```
