# depends_on only affects startup order. The Compose spec never promised teardown order, and Podman Compose doesn’t
# reconstruct the dependency graph when calling down. It just asks libpod to remove the containers it knows about;

# “container already exists.” If there are orphaned containers/volumes from prior runs, Podman Compose also won’t
# clean them up automatically.
# What to do:
# Remove in reverse dependency order yourself (podman rm dependents first)
